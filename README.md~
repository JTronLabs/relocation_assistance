# JTronLabs.github.io



To update the website at http://jtronlabs.github.io I must run 'middleman build' in the MiddleMan_Source directory, and then copy the contents of /build into the top level of this repository.

####MiddleMan
use 'middleman build' to compile assets to usable css and html files
use 'middleman server' to view code changes in real-time at localhost:4567
